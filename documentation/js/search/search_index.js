single page apps. Contains Angular, lodash, Bootstrap 4, Ng-Bootstrap & Ngrx-Store (Redux). Built with Angular CLI.\nAvailable online @ https://jerrolkrause.github.io/angular-starter/#/. \nQuick Start\n# Clone the repo\ngit clone https://github.com/JerrolKrause/angular-starter.git\n\n# Rename directory from `angular-starter` to `your-app`\n\n# Change directory to the repo\ncd your-app\n\n# Install the repo with yarn or npm\nyarn\nnpm iUsage\nSee Angular CLI github page for full usage: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli\n# Serve dev on http://localhost:4200/\nng serve --aot\n\n# Build for prod. Files will appear in the dist folder\nng build --prod\n\n# Serve prod build at http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/.\n# Requires http server which can be installed with `npm install http-server -g`\nnpm run prod\n\n# Run prettier which will format the code in the entire project\nnpm run format\n\n# Run prod build and then use webpack bundle analyzer to check bundle sizes and composition\nnpm run stats\n\n# Automatically generate documentation\nnpm run docs\n\n# Run e2e protractor tests\nng e2e\n\n# Run e2e protractor tests without rebuilding every time (faster)\nng e2e --s false\n\n# Update NPM dependencies via Angular CLI\nng update\n\n# Deploy dist folder to git pages. Be sure to update deploy script in package.json\nnpm run deployLocalizing Your App\npackage.json\n\nIf using github pages, update the npm run deploy command in this file to include the correct slug. IE replace /angular-starter/ with your url\n\nsrc > environments > environment.ts +\nsrc > environments > environment.prod.ts\n\nLocalize environment settings and properties in these files. Enable/disable app functionality as needed.\n\nsrc > app > shared > app.settings.ts\n\nAdd/change global app & environment variables\n\nsrc > index.html\n\nUpdate any header changes to the html in this file. IE logo, navigation, etc. This is a poor man's app-Shell since ng-bootstrap isn't compatible with SSR\n\nsrc > manifest.json\n\nChange the site info in this file to be specific to your app. Make sure the start Url property matches your production URL\n\nsrc > assets > icons\n\nChange these icons to ones for your app\n\nsrc > apple-touch-icon + favicon.ico + safari-pinned-tab.svg\n\nChange these icons to ones for your app\n\nsrc > ngsw-config.json\n\nUpdate any dependencies needed for the service worker. Use asset groups for site resources & use dataGroups for API calls\n\nUseful Tools\nVSCode Tools\n\nPrettier: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode\nTS Lint: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint\n\nVisual Studio Tools\n\nPrettier: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.JavaScriptPrettier\nTS Lint (Note that this requires the project to be in a solution to work): https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.WebAnalyzer\n\nUseful Info\nLazy load libraries. Normally libraries that are shared between lazy loaded routes are all bundled into a single master bundle. This approach will bundle them separately.\n\nAdd a module in app > components > libs > * that imports the library and then exports it\nExport the module in the barrel file in app > components > libs > index.ts\nIn angular.json, add the path to the module in projects > architect > build > options > lazyModules\nIn the module where the library is needed, import the lazy loaded module from the barrel like import { DatagridModule } from '$libs'; and then add to the ngModule imports array\n\nWhen working with Yarn/NPM Link and your local NPM package src folders (uncompiled .ts), use the following boilerplate in your root tsconfig so that Angular CLI will compile and build on save and not throw an Angular package error\n\"include\": [\n    \"src/**/*\",\n
